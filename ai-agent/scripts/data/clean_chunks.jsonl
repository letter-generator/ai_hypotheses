It is shown that the diffusion of atoms, the Ostwald ripening effect, and Brownian movement together control the growth of small size particles. It appears that this stage of initial precipitation lasts for only about 10 s. When the particle diameter exceeds a threshold of 1 μm, the growth process becomes dominated by particle collisions and agglomeration. The efficiency of these mechanisms depends on the particle size distribution as produced during growth. Comprehensive evaluations are still impeded by the limited capacity of computers at present.", "chunk_tokens": 141, "start_token": 0, "end_token": 800}

In order to account for the turbulent circulating flow induced by gas bubbling through the bottom, the kappa-epsilon turbulence model was employed to evaluate time-averaged Reynolds stress while the fluctuation of the free surface of the melt was traced by means of the VOF technique. This model enables to couple transient flow fields, and temperature fields with concentration fields of elements and inclusions in melt so that it can meet the requirements of evolution of time- and space-dependent particle size distributions (PSD) without any given initial PSID of inclusions but directly from chemical reaction. The model was applied to the simulation of the molten steel deoxidation process in Fe-Al-O system in an argon gas-stirred ladle. The model successfully predicted important phenomena including turbulent recirculation flow patterns, streamline structure of steel melt, turbulence energy variation and its dissipation rate, transient temperature fields and particle size distributions of alumina inclusion.

This steel contains very low percentages of residual elements including sulfur and phosphorus, and its contents of aluminum, silicon, and manganese are also very low. The main problem in producing such a steel on an industrial scale is gaining a sufficiently low oxygen content as a precondition for successful desulfurization and high cleanliness. This situation is only possible by applying ladle refining techniques. Two model rotors of this super clean steel were produced and tested. The tests proved complete resistance to temper embrittlement. As an approach for further process development and for the economic production of super clean steels, the mechanism governing the deoxidation was investigated in detail by means of trial heats. The influences of the composition of process slags and the influence of the ladle linings were examined. The deoxidation was found mainly to be based on steel-slag reactions.

From our suite of 6 different metallicity calibrations, we find that only the metallicity calibrations based entirely on the NII/H ratio are affected, showing systematic offsets to higher metallicities by up to 0.04 dex if they are located adjacent to a non-SF flagged spaxel, relative to a radially matched control sample. The inclusion of additional diagnostic diagrams (based on OIamp;/or SII) is insufficient to remove the observed offset in the NII/H based calibrations.

Our simulations are carried out at a mass resolution of 1 M, where the individual supernova explosions are resolved in terms of hot-phase generation and momentum input. We find that mass, energy, and metal loading factors are only weakly affected by the inclusion of a metal diffusion model. The metal enrichment factor at low altitude above the galactic disk is higher by around 20 per cent when the metal diffusion model is included. Specifically, we find more efficient cooling in the cold interstellar medium, as higher amounts of metals are kept in the cold dense phase. The most striking effect of the metal diffusion model is that, without metal diffusion, there is more rapid cooling in the hot phase and a reduced sound speed by a factor of two.

We introduce a method to compute the non-equilibrium ionisation and cooling of diffuse gas exposed to the EGB. Our method iterates the ionisation states of the 11 elements that dominate the cooling and uses tabulated ion-by-ion cooling and photo-heating efficiencies to update the temperature of the gas. Our reaction network includes radiative and di-electric recombination, collisional ionisation, photo-ionisation, Auger ionisation, and charge transfer. We verify that our method reproduces published results for collisional equilibrium, collisional non-equilibrium, and photo-ionised equilibrium. Non-equilibrium effects can become very important in cooling gas, particularly below 106 K. Photo-ionisation and non-equilibrium effects both tend to boost the degree of ionisation and to reduce cooling efficiencies. The effect of the EGB is larger for lower densities. Hence, photo-ionisation affects cooling more under isochoric than under isobaric conditions. Non-equilibrium effects are smaller in the presence of the EGB and are thus overestimated when using collisional-only processes. The inclusion of the EGB alters the observational diagnostics of diffuse, metal-enriched gas (e.g. metal absorption lines) even more significantly than the cooling efficiencies. We argue that the cooling efficiency should be considered if ionisation models are used to infer physical conditions from observed line ratios, as the a priori probability of observing gas is lower if its cooling time is shorter. We provide on-line tables of ionisation fractions and cooling efficiencies for equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. (abridged)", "chunk_tokens": 384, "start_token": 0, "end_token": 800}

The detachment reaction of the metal centre of the porphyrin is investigated both in the gas phase and for molecules adsorbed on the GNR. As most metal porphyrins are very stable against this reaction, it is found that these molecules bind only weakly to a perfect nanoribbon. However, interaction with a single-atom vacancy in the GNR results in chemical bonding by the transition metal centre being shared between nitrogen atoms in the porphyrin ring and the carbon atoms next to the vacancy in the GNR. For both the physisorbed and the chemisorbed geometry, the inclusion of van der Waals interaction results in a significant enlargement of the binding energy and reduction of the adsorption height. Electronic transport calculations using non-equilibrium Greens functions show that the conductivity of the GNR is altered by the chemisorbed porphyrin molecules. Since the metal centers of porphyrins carry an element-specific magnetic moment, not only the net conductance, but also the spin-dependent conductance of the GNR is affected. In particular, the adsorption of Ru-porphyrin on the single-atom vacancy results in a very large spin polarization of the current of 88% at small applied source-drain voltages.

We draw the following conclusions. First, we find that the total number of Lyman photons emitted is almost independent of line blanketing effects and metallicity for a given effective temperature. This is because the flux that is blocked by the forest of metal lines at wavelengths shorter than 600 Angstrom is redistributed mainly within the Lyman continuum. Second, the spectral type, as defined by the ratio of the equivalent widths of HeI 4471 Angstrom and HeII 4542 Angstrom, is shown to depend noticeably on the microturbulent velocity in the atmosphere, on metallicity and, within the luminosity class of dwarfs, on gravity. Third, we confirm the decrease in the effective temperature for a given spectral type due to the inclusion of line blanketing recently found by e.g. Martins et al. (2002). Finally, we find that the SED below 450 Angstrom is highly dependent on metallicity. This is reflected in the behaviour of nebular fine-structure line ratios such as NeIII/NeII 15.5/12.8 and ArIII/ArII 9.0/7.0 micron.

This includes the discussion of the thermodynamics of inclusion formation and the current knowledge on the effects of melt shop processing variable on NMIs composition, amount and size distribution. The development of inclusion engineering  tailoring the process to obtain the desired NMIs is highlighted and the development in selected areas  tire cord, springs and bearing steels as well as prevention of nozzle clogging  is used to illustrate this development. The promising field of oxide metallurgy is also discussed in the context of inclusion engineering. Finally, the difficulties in meaningfully characterizing and quantifying NMIs are briefly commented. In summary it is concluded that inclusion control in steels has evolved significantly in the last decades. This is due to the progress in understanding the interplay between thermodynamics, steel and slag chemical composition as well as melt shop processing. This made possible the tailoring of non-metallic inclusions via processing, to optimize steel properties. Nonetheless, some important problems remain and must still be solved to improve inclusion control and optimization.

NMIs play a decisive role in processes involving ductile fracture, fatigue and corrosion, for instance. These are some of the properties more relevant to the performance of steel in structural and mechanical applications. Furthermore, NMIs may influence nucleation during phase transformations of steel. In this work, the relation of these properties to NMIs is reviewed, highlighting progress and difficulties in each area. Perhaps because of their very low volume fraction, NMIs are sometimes overlooked in the basic physical metallurgy education and their study is left to the realm of those interested in steelmaking. In the last decades a dramatic evolution in the understanding of their relationship to properties, however, has led to significant improvements in many steel products: the outstanding increase of fatigue life in automotive springs and in bearings is one of many such examples. It is concluded that steel improvement in many cases requires inclusion engineering and this can only be achieved through close collaboration between physical metallurgy, process metallurgy and steelmaking. Those who realized this have made significant progress in steel development in recent decades as highlighted in this short review.

The relationship between the transformed acicular ferrite, the inclusions, and the chemical nature of the inclusions which had actually nucleated ferrite laths was examined in detail. By employing weld metals with either intermediate (200350 ppm) or low (1530 ppm) oxygen levels, the inclusion chemistry and nucleation behaviour of acicular ferrite in welds with different oxygen contents were compared. In addition, the influence of the Al/O ratio in lower oxygen content weld metals was also examined. It was found that the first acicular ferrite laths nucleated from the inclusions at both oxygen levels, and the chemical composition of the active inclusions varied considerably. The inclusions nucleated acicular ferrite by acting simply as inert substrates with the ability to reduce the free energy barrier to nucleation. The number and size distribution of the inclusions appeared to be the dominant factors; the thermal stress-strain fields and lattice disregistry were less important. The most favourable type of inclusions were within the size range 0309 μm for the higher oxygen content weld metals and 035075 μm for the lower oxygen level weld metals. A high Al/O ratio depresses the formation of acicular ferrite by increasing the soluble matrix aluminium content, which encourages extensive ferrite sideplate formation; the concurrent variation in inclusion chemical composition did not appear to influence the nucleation of acicular ferrite.MST/3209", "chunk_tokens": 364, "start_token": 0, "end_token": 800}

The influence of reheating temperature, in the range 10001250°C, and finish rolling temperature (starting cooling temperature), in the range 8001000°C, was also studied. Interrupted accelerated cooling caused a double enhancement of grain refinement and an increase of precipitation strengthening resulting in increases of yield strength up to 750 MN m2 and elongations greater than 25%.

However, in previous models suggested for grid cell activity, errors accumulate rapidly in the integration of velocity inputs. To produce grid-cell like responses, these models would require frequent resets triggered by external sensory cues, casting doubt on the dead-reckoning potential of the grid cell system. Here we focus on the accuracy of path integration in continuous attractor models of grid cell activity. We show, in contrast to previous models, that continuous attractor models can generate regular triangular grid responses, based on inputs that encode only the rats velocity and heading. We consider the role of the network boundary in integration performance, and show that both periodic and aperiodic networks are capable of accurate path integration, despite important differences in their attractor manifolds. We show that the rate at which errors accumulate in the integration of velocity depends on the networks organization and size, and on the intrinsic noise within the network. With a plausible range of parameters and the inclusion of spike variability, our model can accurately integrate velocity inputs over a maximum of 10-100 m and 1-10 minutes. These findings form a proof-of-concept that continuous attractor dynamics may underlie velocity integration in dMEC. The simulations also generate pertinent upper bounds on the accuracy of integration that may be achieved by continuous attractor dynamics in the grid cell network.

Self-similarity is an emergent symmetry of gravitational collapse near the threshold of black hole formation. The resulting critical collapse picture has been intensively studied in the past for self-gravitating scalar fields or perfect fluids, but little is known concerning other systems. Here we assess the impact of gauge fields on critical collapse, in the context of low-energy string theories. Matter fields need not inherit the symmetries of a spacetime. We determine the homothetic conditions that scale-invariance of the metric imposes on the dilaton and electromagnetic fields, and we obtain their general solution. The inclusion of a potential for the dilaton is compatible with the homothetic conditions if and only if it is of the Liouville type. By imposing also spherical symmetry, a detailed analysis of critical collapse in these systems is possible by casting the field equations as an autonomous system. We find analytically that Choptuiks critical exponent depends on the dilaton coupling.

This discrepancy degrades performance when model-based controllers and policies learned in simulation are placed on a real robot. We reconcile this issue with a set-valued rigid-body model which generates a broad set of physically reasonable outcomes of simultaneous frictional impacts. We first extend Rouths impact model to multiple impacts by reformulating it as a differential inclusion (DI), and show that any solution will resolve all impacts in finite time. By considering time as a state, we embed this model into another DI which captures the continuous-time evolution of rigid body dynamics, and guarantee existence of solutions.

Such photons are isolated by polarisation discrimination wherein the plane of linear polarisation of the input light is continuously rotated and the polarisation preserving component of the emerging light is extracted by means of a Fourier transform.

Then, integrating the developed optical detection method with swab sampling to achieve to detect bacterial cells loading on stainless-steel surfaces. Using Salmonella enterica  and Escherichia coli as model bacterial cells, we achieved a capture efficiency of up to 76.0 % for SE1045 cells and 81.1 % for E. coli cells at Log 3 CFU/mL upon the optimized conditions. Our assay showed good linear relationship between the concentrations of bacterial cells with the cell counting in images with the limit of detection (LOD) of Log 3 CFU/mL for both SE1045 and E. coli cells. A further increase in sensitivity in detecting E. coli cells was achieved through a heat treatment, enabling the LOD to be pushed as low as Log 2 CFU/mL. Furthermore, successful application was observed in assessing bacterial contamination on stainless-steel surface following integrating with swab collection, achieving a recovery rate of approximately 70 % suggests future prospects for evaluating the cleanliness of surfaces.

The demand for cleaner steels requires lowering non-metallic oxide inclusions and also controlling their morphology, composition and size distribution. Because no single method can measure all of these aspects accurately, it is best to combine several methods together to quantify steel cleanliness in a given operation. Owing to the cost, time requirements, and sampling difficulties, steel cleanliness is widely inferred using total oxygen, nitrogen pick-up, and other indirect methods. Recent cleanliness values using these indicators are summarized for LCAK at many steel plants around the world. Secondly, this paper reviews operating practices to improve steel cleanliness at the ladle, tundish and continuous caster, emphasizing findings quantified with plant measurements. Inclusions come from many sources, including deoxidation, reoxidation, slag entrapment, refractory wear, and chemical reactions. They generate many defects such as cracks and slivers in the steel product. Steel cleanliness is controlled by attention to a wide range of important operating conditions throughout the steelmaking and casting processes. For ladle operations, FeO and MnO in the slag, ladle treatments, and inclusion modification are discussed. For tundish operations, tundish depth and capacity, casting transitions, refractory lining, tundish flux; gas stirring, and flow controls are discussed.

The series of Clean Steel conferences, launched in Hungary in 1970 and organizedn every 4 years since then, with Paul Tardy in the organizing committee or in the lead, haven been providing important time markers of this evolution. Since then, major progress wasn made by the introduction in most steel shops of secondary or ladle metallurgy, which wasn invented in the process, while steel cleanliness was defined precisely in standards andn textbooks. The discoveries of pioneers have become state-of-the art and, today, a steadyn state situation has been reached, where research continues in using new tools and methodsn to refine the topic, while new comers, mainly from the BRIC countries, are contributingn their understanding of the topic to the international steel community. The distinctionn between special steels and carbon steels got blurred in this historical process, asn similar secondary metallurgy tools were used for making both kinds of steels and, inn essence, steel ceased to be a simple commodity and most steels became special to somen extend. Clean steels have thus not become much more sophisticated recently, but rathern much more common and mainstream. The expression clean steel stems from a vision of then purity of the metal in terms of minor elements, which had been controlled until then onlyn at the margin compared to the major elements, iron, carbon, silicon and manganese. This isn today a somewhat passéed vision as metallurgy has become a much more holistic and systemicn technology, whereby steels are defined in terms of global composition, of distribution ofn phases, including the minor phases that are known as non-metallic inclusions, ofn microstructures and, more often than not, in terms of applications and properties inn service. Moreover, steels have time extensions, which are discussed as life cycle or valuen chain and are thus embedded in the anthroposphere and its intersection with the biospheren and the geosphere. This emphasizes the fact that steels are made from raw materials,n primary and secondary  thus including scrap from recycling -, that they are transformedn into artifacts that participate to the life of society and eventually are disposed of atn end of life to feed back into the circular economy.

To comprehend their formation, this study illustrates the time dependency of the layer buildup. Therefore, reactions at the filter/steel interface under quasi static conditions are examined using spark plasma sintering (SPS) equipment. Immersion tests in a steel casting simulator, which provides closetoreality conditions, complement these investigations. Microstructure and phase analyses reveal that interfacial reactions between filter and steel lead to a thin in situ formed layer on the filter surface. During a reactive stage, large polycrystalline alumina structures are formed. Thereby, material is transported both from the carbonbonded material underneath (i.e., gaseous reaction products) and from the molten steel (i.e., precipitating particles and endogenous inclusions) to the filter/steel interface. The formation of these alumina particles comes to an end as soon as the carbon supply, which triggers the dissolution and precipitation processes at the interface, is cutoff. From that point on, endogenous inclusions are deposited on them (active stage).

Yet today, DEI efforts in the industry face growing resistance. As companies retreat from visible commitments, and pushback initiatives started only a few years ago. Aims: This study explores how the DEI backlash is unfolding in the software industry by investigating institutional changes, lived experiences, and the strategies used to sustain DEI practices. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study using 59 publicly available Reddit posts authored by self-identified software professionals. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Our findings show that software companies are responding to the DEI backlash in varied ways, including re-structuring programs, scaling back investments, or quietly continuing efforts under new labels. Professionals reported a wide range of emotional responses, from anxiety and frustration to relief and happiness, shaped by identity, role, and organizational culture. Yet, despite the backlash, multiple forms of resistance and adaptation have emerged to protect inclusive practices in software engineering. Conclusions: The DEI backlash is reshaping DEI in software engineering. While public messaging may soften or disappear, core DEI values persist in adapted forms.

The results show that IP occurs more frequently in women and that the prevalence is particularly high among black women as well as among single and childless women. Furthermore, regardless of gender, software engineering professionals suffering from IP have significantly lower well-being.

This study investigates how LLMs, specifically OpenAIs GPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot, can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes within the software engineering (SE) profession through both textual and graphical outputs. We used each LLM to generate 300 profiles, consisting of 100 gender-based and 50 gender-neutral profiles, for a recruitment scenario in SE roles. Recommendations were generated for each profile and evaluated against the job requirements for four distinct SE positions. Each LLM was asked to select the top 5 candidates and subsequently the best candidate for each role. Each LLM was also asked to generate images for the top 5 candidates, providing a dataset for analysing potential biases in both text-based selections and visual representations. Our analysis reveals that both models preferred male and Caucasian profiles, particularly for senior roles, and favoured images featuring traits such as lighter skin tones, slimmer body types, and younger appearances. These findings highlight underlying societal biases influence the outputs of LLMs, contributing to narrow, exclusionary stereotypes that can further limit diversity and perpetuate inequities in the SE field.

Due to the inhomogeneity of inclusion distribution in the micro-scale, it is not straightforward to quantify the effect of inclusions on fatigue behavior. Various investigations have been performed to correlate the inclusion characteristics, such as inclusion fraction, size, and composition, with fatigue life. However, these studies are generally based on vast types of steels and even for a similar steel grade, the alloy concept and microstructure information can still be of non-negligible difference. For a quantitative analysis of the fatigue life improvement with respect to the inclusion engineering, a systematic and carefully designed study is still needed to explore the engineering dimensions of inclusions. Therefore, in this study, three types of bearing steels with inclusions of the same types, but different sizes and amounts, were produced with 50 kg hot state experiments. The following forging and heat treatment procedures were kept consistent to ensure that the only controlled variable is inclusion. The fatigue properties were compared and the inclusions that triggered the fatigue cracks were analyzed to deduce the critical sizes of inclusions in terms of fatigue failure. The results show that the critical sizes of different inclusion types vary in bearing steels. The critical size of the spinel is 8.5 μm and the critical size of the calcium aluminate is 13.5 μm under the fatigue stress of 1200 MPa. In addition, with the increase of the cleanliness of bearing steels, the improvement of fatigue properties will reach saturation. Under this condition, further increasing of the cleanliness of the bearing steel will not contribute to the improvement of fatigue property for the investigated alloy and process design.", "chunk_tokens": 349, "start_token": 0, "end_token": 800}

It is also noted that there is an approximate 100 °C of undercooling exists in each grade during the solidification. The stable oxide inclusion in the Co85xCrxMn7.5Ni7.5 and Co77.5xCrxFe7.5Mn7.5Ni7.5 alloys is the MnCr2O4 type, while Cr2O3 is the main stable inclusion in the Co85xCrxFe7.5Ni7.5 alloy. Furthermore, the size range of the MnCr2O4 particles is larger than that of Cr2O3. The theoretical calculation shows that MnCr2O4 has a higher coagulation coefficient than Cr2O3 does.

A significant portion of the process adjustment is done during steel refining, where the steel can be tailored so that the desired chemical composition of the non-metallic inclusions that will precipitate can be altered.

Thus, this steel grade has a wide application potential in different fields of industry. The current work provides a fundamental study of the effect of hot-rolling on the inclusion deformation in MMS including a varied 7 to 9 mass pct Mn. Specifically, the deformation behavior of different types of inclusions ( i.e. , Mn(S,Se), liquid oxide (MnSiO 3 ), MnAl 2 O 4 , and complex oxy-sulfide) was investigated. The results show that both MnSiO 3 and Mn(S,Se) are soft inclusions which are able to be deformed during the hot-rolling process but MnAl 2 O 4 does not. The aspect ratio of soft inclusions increases significantly from as-cast to hot-rolling conditions. When the maximum size of different inclusions is similar, Mn(S,Se) deforms more than MnSiO 3 does. This is due to a joint influence of physical parameters including Youngs modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion (α), etc. However, when the maximum size of one type of inclusion ( e.g., MnSiO 3 ) is much larger than another one ( e.g., Mn(S,Se)), this maximum size of soft inclusions plays a dominant role than other factors. In addition, the deformation behavior of dual-phase inclusion depends on the major phase, i.e. , either oxide or sulfide. Last but not least, empirical correlations between the reduction ratio of the thickness of plate, grain size, and aspect ratio of oxide and sulfide inclusions after hot-rolling are provided quantitatively.

In consequence, chemical dissolution of the tool into the chip occurs by a diffusion mechanism, causing chemical wear. Oxley incorporated the concept of seizure in his quantitative model for flow chip morphology. Oxley introduced the concept of equilibrium shear angle in his quantitative model for flow chip morphology, which incorporates the work of shear in the secondary shear zone instead of friction, once atomic contact is established, but Oxleys model ignored potential interaction from metallurgical softening events in the secondary shear zone, which led to prediction of unrealistically high temperature at high cutting speeds. In fact, metallurgical softening events do occur particularly at high cutting speeds, causing shear localisation, which leads to significant deviation from Oxleys model predictions. In this paper, Oxleys model will be extended to capture the interaction of shear localisation in the secondary shear zone on the mechanics of metal cutting. Dynamic recrystallisation, phase transformation of the matrix and geometric softening owing to second phase particles are identified as important microstructural softening events causing shear localisation, which could intervene before the equilibrium shear angle is reached. The occurrence of shear localisation is shown to alter the mechanics of metal cutting, chip morphology and the tool wear mechanism. A phenomenological database in model alloys will be presented to validate the model assumptions. The application of the model in the design of self-lubricating free cutting steel for moderate and high cutting speeds will be examined.Keywords: METAL CUTTINGFERROUS ALLOYSCHIP FORMATIONSOFTENINGTOOL WEAR", "chunk_tokens": 355, "start_token": 0, "end_token": 800}

Here, to prevent such oxidation-induced Cr-depletion in corrosion-resistant alloys, we proposed a general strategy based on inclusion engineering using oxygen-preferred elements in alloy design. The inclusion-Cr depletion-passivation relationship was systematically studied in 3.5 wt% NaCl using commercially cast original, Si-modified, Al-modified, and Ti-modified CoCrFeMnNi alloys, in which the prominent inclusions were identified as MnCr2O4, MnO-SiO2, AlN, and TiN, respectively. Unlike the original alloy, all modified alloys prevented Cr-depletion with improved corrosion resistance; however, the Si-modified alloy exhibited the most remarkable improvement due to few nitride by-products. Thermodynamic analysis on the free energy changes of potential reactions revealed that all the additives were preferential to be oxidized over Cr, whereas Al and Ti nitridation reactions have the most negative free energies compared to all oxidation reactions, which validated experimental results. From experiments and thermodynamics, an effective method was proposed, and its application was discussed with three newly-designed alloys prepared using arc melting.

In the present study, the mechanical behavior of bulk nanocrystalline Al-Mg-Y is examined with macroscale compression testing, probing a length scale that is relevant to real-world structural applications. Bulk samples were fabricated via a simple powder metallurgy approach, with different pressing temperatures and times employed for consolidation in order to investigate microstructural and property evolution. All of the specimens contained primary face-centered cubic Al and secondary Al4C3 and Al3Y phases, with the Al3Y particles exhibiting two populations of small equiaxed and larger elongated particles. Appreciable plasticity was measured along with high ultimate stresses over 800 MPa due to the presence of amorphous grain boundary complexions. Microstructural characterization of fracture surfaces revealed that the area fraction of dimpled regions increased with longer hot-pressing time. Most importantly, the elongated Al3Y particles formed regular cellular patterns with increasing hot-pressing time, delaying shear localization and significantly enhancing plasticity.

For example, in geological reservoirs rock matrix porosity varies vertically due to geomechanical compaction trends, in mineral deposits grades vary due to sedimentation and concentration processes, in hydrology rainfall varies due to the atmosphere and topography interactions, and in metallurgy crystalline structures vary due to differential cooling. Conventional geostatistical modeling workflows rely on the assumption of stationarity to be able to model spatial features for the geostatistical inference. Nevertheless, this is often not a realistic assumption when dealing with nonstationary spatial data and this has motivated a variety of nonstationary spatial modeling workflows such as trend and residual decomposition, cosimulation with secondary features, and spatial segmentation and independent modeling over stationary subdomains. The advent of deep learning technologies has enabled new workflows for modeling spatial relationships. However, there is a paucity of demonstrated best practice and general guidance on mitigation of spatial nonstationarity with deep learning in the geospatial context. We demonstrate the impact of two common types of geostatistical spatial nonstationarity on deep learning model prediction performance and propose the mitigation of such impacts using self-attention (vision transformer) models. We demonstrate the utility of vision transformers for the mitigation of nonstationarity with relative errors as low as 10%, exceeding the performance of alternative deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks. We establish best practice by demonstrating the ability of self-attention networks for modeling large-scale spatial relationships in the presence of commonly observed geospatial nonstationarity.", "chunk_tokens": 323, "start_token": 0, "end_token": 800}

Appearing initially in metallurgy and as a model for the evolution of grain boundaries, this flow was later treated by Brakke citeBr using varifold methods. There is good reason to treat this problem by a direct PDE approach, but doing so requires one to deal with the singular nature of the PDE at the vertices of the network. This was handled in cases of increasing generality by Bronsard-Reitich citeBrRe, Mantegazza-Novaga-Tortorelli citeMNT and eventually, in the most general case of irregular networks by Ilmanen-Neves-Schulze citeINS. Although the present paper proves a result similar to the one in citeINS, the method here provides substantially more detailed information about how an irregular network resolves into a regular one. Either approach relies on the existence of self-similar expanding solutions found in citeMS. As a precursor to and illustration of the main theorem, we also prove an unexpected regularity result for the mixed Cauchy-Dirichlet boundary problem for the linear heat equation on a manifold with boundary.", "chunk_tokens": 248, "start_token": 0, "end_token": 800}

In this presentation, the main features of mixing liquid steel by gas stirring are discussed. The criteria for bubbling and jetting during gas injection are considered including interaction of powder load on flow regimes. It is of interest to know the domains of bubbling and jetting behaviour in order to minimize the effect of back attack which is responsible for additional wear of bottom linings and tuyere pipes. Quantitative information is given on velocity, the radius and the pumping capacity of the buoyant plume. The relations lead to the conclusion that the gas flow should be apportioned to two or more plugs in order to increase the efficiency of the pumping effect. Furthermore, the macroscopic flow pattern is substantially influenced by the ratio of height to diameter of the ladle. Especially at high ratios dead volumes near the ladle bottom are observed. Further examples for the influence of fluid flow on reactions, dispersing and separating in the ladle and tundish are given. At first approach, mixing time depends on the gas flow rate or on the specific power input. But the details are much more complicated. It is shown that the mixing process can be described by two types of models among others: the turbulent recirculation model and the model of partial volumes. The comparison of calculated concentrationtimedependencies with plant results confirms the practicability and usefulness of the model of partial volumes. It is also concluded that the water model results for ladles may be transferred to plant conditions. In total all examples that are discussed emphasize the great significance of model simulations and model calculations as instruments for process improvement and process development.", "chunk_tokens": 337, "start_token": 0, "end_token": 800}

But the process control is even now based on empirical rules. Deviations from the sulphur contents aimed at can often be observed in practice. An improvement of the process control supported by knowledge of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the desulphurisation reaction is of great importance, especially for the production of steels with very low sulphur contents. To investigate the removal of sulphur, operational trials were carried out in 185 t steel ladles. In the trials the stirring gas flow rate, the pressure on the bath surface and the steel composition were varied as process parameters. The obtained results show that ladle slags saturated with lime have a high sulphide capacity. The desulphurisation rate of steel melts increases if the specific stirring energy is enhanced by increasing the gas flow rate or reducing the pressure on the bath surface. In the case of production of Al/Sikilled steel melts, a desulphurisation degree above 90 % can be obtained by a vacuum treatment within 10 minutes.", "chunk_tokens": 246, "start_token": 0, "end_token": 800}

The compositions of the oxide melts were chosen to correspond to those of ladle slags in secondary metallurgy and to casting powders in continuous casting of steel. The first model uses Butlers equation to calculate the surface tensions of the multicomponent melts and is based on Tanaka et al.s consideration of the ionic radii of the components as well as surface tensions and molar volumes of pure components. In the second model the same ionic radii dependent contribution is applied as activity coefficients to a constrained free energy model where the surface layer is considered as a separate phase in the system. In the model, the constrained interfacial area is analogous with a component mass balance in a traditional computation of a multiphase chemical equilibrium and surface energy with the corresponding chemical potential. Based on the results it is concluded that the effect of temperature on the surface tensions of the considered oxide melts is insignificant when compared to the effect of chemical composition. According to the validation the results agree well with published surface tension data. The multicomponent surface tension approach provides a practical method for evaluation of e.g. functioning of various casting powders in industrial steel casting practice.", "chunk_tokens": 284, "start_token": 0, "end_token": 800}

In this work, a method to analyze spectral reflectance of ladle furnace slag samples to estimate their composition is proposed. This method does not require sample preprocessing and is based on a regression algorithm that mathematically maps the spectral reflectance of the slag with its actual composition with errors lower than 10%. Specifically designed normalization and calibration steps have been proposed to allow a global model training with data from different locations. This allows real-time monitoring of the thermodynamical state of the steel process by feeding a thermodynamic equilibrium optimization model.

The after-corrosion refractory was investigated in view of changes in its microstructure and phase composition by SEM/EDS and XRD techniques, respectively. At 1350 °C slags slightly infiltrated the microstructure, whereas at 1450 °C slags infiltrated the alumina-spinel refractory causing its significant corrosion. As a result of corrosion, new phases were formed, including calcium dialuminate (Ca2Al4O7), calcium hexaluminate (CaAl12O19), and gehlenite (Ca2AlSi2O7). Formation of calcium aluminate layers in the microstructure of the refractory inhibited further dissolution of alumina aggregates; however, expansive behavior of CaAl12O19 raised the microstructure porosity.
